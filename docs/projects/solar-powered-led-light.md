## {Step 1 @fullscreen}

Go to [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com). Sign in or create an account, and click on 'Create new Circuit'.

## {Step 2}

In the components section, search for and drag a 'Solar Panel' or 'Photovoltaic Cell' onto the workspace. Then, find an ‘LED’ and place it near the solar panel.

## {Step 3}

Wiring the Components:
- Connect the positive terminal of the solar panel to the anode (longer leg) of the LED.
- Connect the negative terminal of the solar panel to the cathode (shorter leg) of the LED.

## {Step 4 @fullscreen}

Start the Simulation:
- Click on the ‘Start Simulation’ button.
- Observe the LED lighting up, powered by the solar panel.

## {Step 5}

Experiment with light intensities:
- Adjust the properties of the solar panel in Tinkercad.
- Notice how LED brightness changes with light intensity.

## {Step 6}

Discussion Points:
- Discuss the conversion of sunlight into electrical energy by solar panels.
- Explain the operation of the LED with the solar panel.

## {Step 7}

Advanced Activities:
- Add a voltmeter to measure the solar panel's output voltage.
- Create circuits with LEDs in series and parallel.

## {Step 8}

Safety First:
- Ensure correct connections to prevent short circuits.
- Follow safety protocols as in real-life scenarios.

## Conclusion

You've now built a basic solar-powered LED light! This project demonstrates the principles of solar power and electronics. Check your work [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/fq3OVZV82lT-solar-powered-light).
